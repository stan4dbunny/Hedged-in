# Hedged-in
Hello! This is our website that we made for our game that we created in the course DH2413 in advanced graphics and interaction.

# Game description
A collaborative, asymetric VR game in which one player in VR tries to escape a maze, with the help of a friend that can see the maze from top-down and help their friend out by opening and closing walls, as well as luring away monsters.
